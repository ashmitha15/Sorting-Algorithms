# Sorting-Algorithms

A project which implements the sorting algorithm to sort the given unsorted array and returns the result as a
sorted array with the time complexity of the algorithm. The following are the algorithms implemented:
1. Insertion Sort
2. Merge Sort
3. Selection Sort
4. Bubble Sort
5. Heap Sort
6. Quick Sort
7. Quick Sort using 3 medians

TOOLS:
The following project is implemented using Java Servlets in Eclipse
LANGUAGE: JAVA
 1. Java IDE: Eclipse Neon Version 4.6.0
 2. Java Development kit 1.8.0_341
 3. Java Run time Environment 1.8.0_341
GUI: Implemented using HTML5 and CSS3

Steps to use:
1. Enter the size of the input
2. Enter the order in which the input has to be generated.
3. Choose the algorithm to sort and find out the time complexities of the corresponding Algorithm.
4. Click "Submit" button.
5. A page is redirected with the sorted array and the time complexities of the chosen algorithms.
